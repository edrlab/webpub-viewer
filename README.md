# webpub-viewer

A viewer application for web publications, based on [NYPL’s prototype](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/webpub-viewer), which is itself based on [Hadrien Gardeur’s proof of concept](https://github.com/HadrienGardeur/webpub-viewer).

## Quickstart

Clone this repo, `cd` the directory, checkout the `master` then

```
npm install
```

This should run the `npm run build` script as well, transpiling the TS and SASS files into the `dist` and `viewer` folders.

You can run automated tests with

```
npm test
```

and transpile at any time with

```
npm run build
```

## Examples

Examples demonstrate how this webpub-viewer can be used:

1. with static assets i.e. exploded EPUB files on a server;
2. with assets served by r2-streamer-js (in-memory model);
3. embedded in exploded EPUB files themselves.

Example EPUBs *The Call of the Wild* and *A Journey to the Centre of the Earth* have been kindly offered by Jellybooks.

### Static

The `examples/static` folder contains the webpub-viewer (`viewer` folder), two example files (`TheCallOfTheWild` and `AJourneyToTheCentreOfTheEarth` folders), and a `static-server.js` script running a local server using Node.js + Express.

This example runs on `https` so you’ll need to trust the provided `webpubViewer.pem` self-signed certificate that node and express use to create an https server.

#### Re-generating a self-signed certificate

From the repository’s root, the following command has been used on MacOS to create the certificate for `localhost`:

```
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -x509 -nodes -keyout webpubViewer.pem -new -out webpubViewer.pem -subj /CN=localhost -reqexts SAN -extensions SAN -config <(cat /System/Library/OpenSSL/openssl.cnf <(printf '[SAN]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost')) -sha256 -days 3650
```

The one provided should run until October 24, 2028.

What’s important is that the cert must have `CN=localhost` and `subjectAltName=DNS:localhost` for Chrome. Versions > 58 indeed require a `subjectAltName` with the proper DNS and/or IP entry/entries.

#### Trusting self-signed certificates

In order to make the self-signed certificate trusted you need to accept it as a valid certificate on your machine. Doing this will replace red warning (“Unsecured”) notices with a green lock, fully replicating a `https/SSL` website on localhost for testing. This depends on your platform:

- [MacOS > Keychain.app](https://www.kevinleary.net/self-signed-trusted-certificates-node-js-express-js/)
- [Ubuntu-flavored Linux Distro > certutil](https://leehblue.com/add-self-signed-ssl-google-chrome-ubuntu-16-04/)
- [Windows 10 > Trusted Root Certification Authorities](https://medium.com/@alirak94/how-to-trust-any-self-signed-ssl-certificate-in-ie11-and-edge-fa7b416cac68)

You might need to make it an exception in your web browser so that it can be trusted though (Firefox, Safari, etc.).

#### Usage

- Update the webpub-viewer files if needed (`npm run examples`)
- Launch the webpub-viewer with `npm run static`
- Your terminal should display `Express server listening on port 3333` – note it’s also listening to errors so will log them in your terminal as well
- open https://localhost:3333 in the browser
- To stop the server, type `ctrl + c`

Both examples are available on the same origin, as cross-origin will be restricted by browsers and throw an error in the viewer.

For the origin to be considered the same, protocol (`http/https`), host and port must be the same. See [web browsers’ same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).

### Streamed

The `examples/streamed` folder contains the webpub-viewer (`misc/readers/reader-NYPL` folder) and example files (`epubs` folder).

In this example, assets are served by the r2-streamer-js (in-memory model). You can open them using different reader implementations. This iteration of webpub-viewer is labelled as "Reader NYPL".

This example runs on `http` to get around Service Workers issues across all available readers so you don’t need to do anything.

#### Usage

- Update the web reader files if needed (`npm run examples`)
- Start the server with `npm run streamed`
- Open http://localhost:4444 in the browser
- Pick a publication
- You can see its manifest (`json`) and open it in the webpub-viewer of your choice
- To stop the server, type `ctrl + c`

### Embedded

The `examples/embedded` folder contains an example file (`alice` folder), in which the webpub-viewer is embedded, and an `embedded-server.js` script running a local server using Node.js + Express. 

This example runs on `https` but is using the same certificate as the static example.

#### Usage

- Update the webpub-viewer files if needed (`npm run examples`)
- Launch the webpub-viewer with `npm run embedded`
- Your terminal should display `Express server listening on port 1865` – note it’s also listening to errors so will log them in your terminal as well
- open https://localhost:1865 in the browser
- To stop the server, type `ctrl + c`

## Testing

### Unit testing

By running: 

```
npm test
```

You’ll launch 200+ automated tests to make sure everything is OK.

### Visual Regression Testing

We are also using [backstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) to test for visual regressions. It can indeed help catch issues with user settings and/or features that would be a lot more difficult to catch in unit testing.

It is preferrable you install backstopjs globally as it is a massive download, and is meant as a command that can be used with different projects – note that if installed locally, it will be tied to npm scripts.

```
npm install -g backstopjs
```

Since those tests are relying on Pupeteer, so you’ll also need Chrome/Chromium – ideally latest.

Then you’ll have to launch the `https` server locally with:

```
npm run static
```

The first time you run visual regression tests, you’ll need to create reference screenshots with:

```
npm run visual-test:init
```

Then

```
npm run visual-test
```

This will test different scenarios, with possible interactions from the user e.g. displaying the TOC, changing the font or font-size, picking sepia or night mode…

A browser window/tab will open with the report so that you can take a deeper look.

If you encounter visual inconsistencies backstopJS doesn’t report on your first run, then do:

```
npm run visual-test:update
```

This will update the reference screenshots.

You can also use this command when you made a significant cosmetic change or added new features. 

## Icons

Icons used in the shared version are part of the official [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=outline) collection (outline version).

## Notes

This version sticks to the existing NYPL architecture, with features added in the spirit of its design.

It fixes some bugs and make their dedicated tests more robust. It was primarily meant as a Proof of Concept readers @ Jellybooks could interact with.

Refactorings ([architecture](https://github.com/readium/architecture), [ReadiumCSS](https://github.com/readium/readium-css), [r2-glue-js](https://github.com/readium/r2-glue-js), etc.) are longer term but have been planned.
